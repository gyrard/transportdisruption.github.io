{"name":"The Transport Disruption Ontology","tagline":"Modelling travel and transport related events and their disruptive impact on the (travel) plans of agents","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe Transport Disruption ontology provides a formal framework for modelling travel and transport related events that have a disruptive impact on an agent's planned travel.\r\n\r\nThe ontology can be considered as consisting of two main sections: classes modelling the disruptive event and its impact on an agentâ€™s plan, and a hierarchy of travel and transport related events.  \r\n\r\nFor details of the ontology itself, please see [the ontology documentation](https://transportdisruption.github.io/transportdisruption.html).  The ontology is also available in [TTL](https://transportdisruption.github.io/transportdisruption.ttl) and [RDF/XML](https://transportdisruption.github.io/transportdisruption.owl) encodings either directly or through content negotiation using the [http://purl.org/td/transportdisruption](http://purl.org/td/transportdisruption) namespace.\r\n\r\n### Example Events\r\nThroughout this page, examples are defined in the TTL format using the following namespaces:\r\n\r\n     @prefix td: <http://purl.org/td/transportdisruption#>.\r\n     @prefix tl: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#>.\r\n     @prefix event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#>.\r\n     @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\r\n     @prefix geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>.\r\n     @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.\r\n     @prefix eg: <http://www.example.com#>.\r\n     @base <http://www.example.com#>.\r\n\r\nWhile the ontology documentation is useful, some examples are also useful! Lets consider an simple example where there will be roadworks on Union Street in Aberdeen, UK taking place overnight from 19:00 on Monday 20 October 2015 until 06:00 Tuesday 21 October 2015, and as a result the road will be closed.  This can be represented as:\r\n\r\n    eg:roadworks a td:Roadworks;\r\n       event:place eg:roadworksLocation;\r\n       event:time eg:mondayNight.\r\n\r\n    eg:roadworksLocation a geo:Point;\r\n       geo:lat \"57.146451\"\r\n       geo:long \"-2.09872\"\r\n\r\n    eg:mondayNight a tl:Interval;\r\n       tl:beginsAtDateTime \"2015-10-20T19:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\r\n       tl:endsAtDateTime \"2015-10-21T07:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime.\r\n\r\n    eg:roadclosure a td:RoadClosure;\r\n       event:place <http://linkedgeodata.org/page/triplify/way95288246>;\r\n       event:time eg:mondayNight;\r\n       event:factor :roadworks.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to note about this example: \r\n* The roadworks are located with a geolocation consisting of latitude and longitude values specifying where the roadworks are taking place.\r\n* The road closure is located using the [LinkedGeoData](http:// linkedgeodata.org) representation of one of the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) ways for [Union Street, Aberdeen, UK](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/95288246).  As this particular road consists of multiple ways, we could have added them all, but this particular one is fine indicating the part of the road that is closed.  \r\n* As both the roadworks and road closure occur at the same time, they use the same interval (defined using the [Interval class of the Timeline ontology](http://motools.sourceforge.net/timeline/timeline.html#term_Interval)).\r\n* The relationship between the two events (i.e. that the road closure is due to the roadworks) is captured by the `eg:roadclosed event:factor :roadworks` triple.\r\n\r\n### Example Disruption\r\nOK, so we have some events, now lets consider the travel plans of Bob, who was due to drive along that part of Union Street on his way to work that evening:\r\n\r\n     eg:bob a faof:Person;\r\n        td:hasPlan eg:driveToWork.\r\n    \r\n     eg:bobsDriveToWork a td:Plan;\r\n        eg:time [ tl:beginsAtDateTime \"2015-10-20T20:30:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\r\n                  tl:endsAtDateTime \"2015-10-20T20:55:00\"^^xsd:dateTime. ]\r\n        eg:route [ ....\r\n                    <http://linkedgeodata.org/page/triplify/way95288246>,\r\n                 ... ].\r\n\r\nAs Bob will be travelling when the road is closed, he is not going to be able to complete his journey as normal.  Most likely he is going to have to divert his route to avoid the road closure.  Using the Transport Disruption ontology, this could be represented as follows:\r\n\r\n     eg:alternativeRouteNecessary a td:DisruptiveImpact;\r\n         td:relevantTo eg:bob;\r\n         td:impactsOn eg:bobsDriveToWork;\r\n         td:hasCause eg:roadclosure.\r\n\r\nAs `td:hasCause` is the inverse property of `td:casuseOf` the triple `eg:alternativeRouteNecessary td:hasCause eg:roadclosure` will result in the following inference\r\n\r\n    eg:roadclosure td:causeOf eg:alternativeRouteNecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd as such the `eg:roadclosure` is now considered to be a disruptive event as it has had a disruptive impact on Bob's travel plans, captured by the following assertion:\r\n\r\n    eg:roadclosure a td:DisruptiveEvent.\r\n\r\nThe full example is [available here](https://github.com/transportdisruption/transportdisruption.github.io/blob/master/example.ttl).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
